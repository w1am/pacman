**PyGame Pacman**
Pacman is a 1980s video game in which the player controls a yellow circular character through a maze in order to avoid being trapped by four hunting ghosts with different attack strategies. The goal is to get the highest score possible by collecting pellets, which can occasionally be used as power-ups.

**Installations**
| Package | Version |
|--|--|
| PyGame | 2.0.0 |

    py -m pip install -U pygame=2.0.0 --user
    
**Implementation**
The entire game was designed using the PyGame GUI module, which was assessed based on the Pacman game's various criteria and requirements. Our core GUI library had to run across multiple platforms and operating systems, be fast enough, and adhere to our programming style. It was observed that the object-oriented approach will be better for us because it helps us to build modular designs and makes software maintenance easier to manage in future updates. In terms of storage, we wanted something simple and quick. We found that pickle would be optimal for storing Python objects in a byte stream. It allows us to store and easily update data while the game is running.

**Ghost Patterns**
Each ghost has a unique method for capturing Pacman. To see the grid and target lines. set **DEBUG** to True
